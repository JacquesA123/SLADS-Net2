# Particle info

# SEM Settings
SEM_image_length = 6.24e-5 # Can be from around 2.4e-6 to 6.98e-4 meters
shift_between_images_length = SEM_image_length * 2 # Multiply by a constant for extra cushion to prevent detection of duplicate features

# EDS Settings
dwell_time = 2 # Amount of EDS Acquisition time per particle

# Image Processing Settings
threshold_intensity = 125 # Values below this will be filtered out as background

## Run the project ##

# Global variables
